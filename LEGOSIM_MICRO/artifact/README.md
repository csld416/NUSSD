# Artifact for LEGOSim: A Unified Parallel Simulation Framework for Multi-chiplet Heterogeneous Integration

## Experiment Workflow

### 1. Run multi-chiplet system with different topologies and flit sizes (Figure 16, 17)
---
To run the multi-chiplet system with different topologies, you can use the provided script `run.sh` in the directory of each benchmark. This script will iterate through various topologies (mesh, meshll, NVL, star, torus) and flit sizes (2, 4), applying necessary modifications to the configuration files.

- bfs:
```bash
cd bfs_cuda
bash run.sh
```
- matmul:
```bash
cd matmul 
bash run.sh
```
- MLP:
```bash
cd mlp
bash run.sh
```
- Transformer:

As the transformer benchmark was built with libtorch library, libtorch 2.0.0+cpu and gcc/g++ 9.4.0 or higher is required. You can set the compiler in the `CMakeLists.txt` file as follows:
```bash
set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "<LibTorch path>") 
# In CMakeLists.txt, change the compiler to gcc-9 and g++-9
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "<gcc-9.4.0 path>/bin/gcc")
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "<gcc-9.4.0 path>/bin/g++")
```
Then, compile the transformer to test the environment:
```bash
cd transformer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```
To run the transformer benchmark with different topologies and flit sizes, use the following command:
```bash
cd ..
bash run.sh
```
Note: The MLP and Transformer benchmarks need several day to finish all the simulations. If you want to have a quick test, you can run bfs or matmul benchmarks at first.


### 2. Run multi-chiplet system with different inter-chiplet communication protocols (PCIe, UCIe) (Figure 18)
---
To run the multi-chiplet system with different inter-chiplet communication protocols, you can enter the `UCIe_PCIe` directory and execute the `run.sh` script. This script will iterate through the different protocols and apply necessary modifications to the configuration files.

```bash
cd UCIe_PCIe
bash run.sh
```

### 3. Run multi-chiplet system with different storage configurations (DDR5, HBM3)(Figure 18)
---
To run the multi-chiplet system with different storage configurations, you can enter the `HBM_DDR` directory and execute the `run.sh` script. This script will iterate through the different storage configurations and apply necessary modifications to the configuration files.

```bash
cd HBM_DDR
bash run.sh
```

### 4. Analyze synchronization overhead (Figure 10)
```
python sync_overhead.py
```
This script will generate a plot showing the synchronization overhead for different synchronization methods.

### 5. Exploring the Design Space of On-chip Buffer and Inter-chiplet Interconnection Network (Figure 13, 15)
```
cd DSE
bash run.sh
```

## Output Interpretation
The output of each benchmark will be stored in the `result_{topology}_flit_{flit_size}.log` files and the smulation cycle will be stored in the `result_{topology}_flit_{flit_size}.txt` files. You can analyze these results to compare the performance of different configurations. Besides, every simulation will generate a heat map which visualizes the inter-chiplet traffic distributions of each benchmark. Computation or communication bottleneck of each chiplet will be stored in the `bottleneck_{topology}_flit_{flit_size}.log` files. Figure 10 can be obtained through running the sync_overhead.py python file, and
Figure 13 and 15 can be generated through running the run.sh in the DSE directory.
